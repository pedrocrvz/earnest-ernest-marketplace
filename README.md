# Project Requirements

## User Interface Requirements:

- [] Run the app on a dev server locally for testing/grading
- [] You should be able to visit a URL and interact with the application
  - [] App recognizes current account
  - [] Sign transactions using MetaMask or uPort
  - [] Contract state is updated
  - [] Update reflected in UI

## Test Requirements:

- [] Write 5 tests for each contract you wrote
  - [] Solidity or JavaScript
- [] Explain why you wrote those tests
- [] Tests run with truffle test

## Design Pattern Requirements:

- [] Implement a circuit breaker (emergency stop) pattern
- [] What other design patterns have you used / not used?
  - [] Why did you choose the patterns that you did?
  - [] Why not others?

## Security Tools / Common Attacks:

- [] Explain what measures youâ€™ve taken to ensure that your contracts are not susceptible to common attacks

## Use a library or extend a contract

- [] Via EthPM or write your own

## Other

- [] Deploy your smart contract(s) onto one of the test (i.e. Rinkeby, Ropsten) networks.
- [] Include a document called deployed_addresses.txt that describes where your contracts live (which testnet and address).
  Evaluators can check the appropriate testnet etherscan at the provided addresses to verify deployment
